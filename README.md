# daily-planner
Using JS and CSS I'm going to make a daily planner so that I can keep track of my tasks in an average workday.

Sorry for the poor commit chain. I started this project before I understood good commit habits,
this finished product completes an assignment that I couldn't complete before. Now that I understand
localstorage better I came back to finish the live site!
